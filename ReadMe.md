# Lab4 Gen AI for computer Vision

This repository contains the lab4 for the "*Generative AI for Computer Vision*" course at EFREI, 2025.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to approach the concept of Diffusion Models. [The base dataset](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIFAR-10).
